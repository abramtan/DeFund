# DeFund: The Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform

DeFund is a decentralized crowdfunding platform that allows users to create and manage campaigns, donate to campaigns, and track the progress of campaigns. The platform is built using a combination of Next.js, and Solidity smart contracts deployed to the Sepolia Ethereum testnet.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into 2 key components:

- **Frontend (Next.js)**: Located in the `frontend/nextjs` directory, contains code for the web app.
- **Backend**: Located in the `backend` directory, this part of the project contains the Solidity smart contracts and scripts for deployment.
